			<h2> Finders Fee Tutors </h2>
			
			<p> 
				For tutors on our finders fee pricing (over 95%), we take a simple, one off payment for the tutor's<br>
				contact details. We do not take any ongoing commission from the tutors on this pricing model.
			</p>
		
			<ul>
				
				<li><p>No sign up fees - you can register for no charge, and browse and communicate with our entire database of thousands of tutors.</p></li>
			
				<p><li>Pay online securely using PayPal, even if you do not have a PayPal account.</li></p>
			
				<p><li>Some of our tutors also provide a discounted 1st lesson when you purchase their details.</li></p>
				
				<p><li>Since 2005 Tutor Hunt has helped thousands of students find the right tutor.<p></li>
			
			</ul>
			
			<p>
				Most tuition agencies will select your tutor for you, based on who they think would be suitable.<br>
				Tutor Hunt doesn't work this way: we believe the parent, or the student themselves to be the best<br>
				judge. They will know better than an agency assessor who is the right tutor for them.<br>
				Most agencies work by charging high commission rates, taking a substantial cut of the tutor's<br>
				earnings. This has the effect of driving up the tutor's hourly rate considerably, as the tutor will<br>
				seek to recoup their lost funds. The hourly rates of finder's fee tutors should be less than those<br>
				with added commission, as they are in complete control of their rates.<br>
